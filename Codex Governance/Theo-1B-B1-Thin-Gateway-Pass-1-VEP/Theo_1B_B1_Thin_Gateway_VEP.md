# Theo Phase 1B — B1 Thin Model Gateway (HF-T1, stateless) — Pass 1 Verified Evidence Pack

> Pipeline: Vault Theo backend. Author = Claude Code (Pass 1). Reviewer = **Codex** (Pass 2). Plan-only; no implementation deployed (Walter deploys). First B1 microstep of the gateway-first sequence: a stateless `POST /api/theo_message` handler that brokers to Anthropic Claude via Azure AI Foundry (connection proven 2026-06-26). No `theo_*` schema in scope (persistence is Tier B3).

## Grounding Conformance Receipt
Role: Claude Code
Turn Type: Verified Evidence Pack (backend plan)
Turn issued against HEAD: `787a9a33e2ee643412e83bf4ada58b245bd4f788` (vault-theo, `development`)
Grounding Mode: Delta Grounding
Pass: Pass 1
Sub-phase Track: P8

Delta scope (Conformance §3 rule 8) — reflects the **final, deployment-verified** B1 state. **(1)** §HG.1 inlines the complete `reporting_probe_dms_connection` source (blob `e415e802874f5416e4da0098b34721a1e9bfdc3f`) **byte-for-byte identical** (`diff` → no difference, 379 lines incl. `isUuid`). **(2)** §HG.3's 10 shared Family-B envelope/util helpers (`send`/`nowIso`/`errorBody`/`successBody`/`getPrincipal`/`getClaimValue`/`parseBody`/`buildKnownError`/`parseJsonSafe`/`requestUrl`) are **byte-identical to the deployed `reporting_probe_dms_connection`** (verified 10/10); `corsHeaders` differs only in `Allow-Methods`; §HG.4 matches the deployed binding shape except `methods`/`route`. **(3)** **Token method (Walter directive §WA):** built on the deployed raw-`https` token-exchange mechanism (`requestUrl` → `login.microsoftonline.com`, app `AAD_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`) — **no `@azure/identity` SDK**. Iteration recorded for audit: the SDK/managed-identity approach failed (not installed → empty-500); the OBO variant hit `AADSTS65001` (no delegated-permission API for `https://ai.azure.com` in the Entra picker); the **deployment-verified** method is **client-credentials (app-only token)** for scope `https://ai.azure.com/.default`, authorized at the Foundry resource by an RBAC role on the app's service principal. This **diverges from architecture §2.2/DR-T2 ("managed identity, keyless")** — disclosed §GR G-5 with a PRE-LAND Role-C. Deploy artifacts (`api/theo_message/{index.js,function.json}`) are byte-equal to §HG.3/§HG.4. Other GCR documents read at the Full-Baseline pack `787a9a3` (same session, unchanged at current HEAD).
Cross-repo reference HEAD: corporate-reporting `eafa2b3b7ac76a0fc1886651ccc0600e748b0800` (Primary Reference handler source).
Currency anchors: per Conformance §8 fallback, the blob SHA (obtained via `git rev-parse HEAD:<path>`) is given for each row — region reads of code/structural docs; independently verifiable via `git cat-file -p <sha>`. Row 10 (`reporting_probe_dms_connection.index.js.md`) was re-read in full this turn for the T9 correction.

## P1 — Feature identification
Microstep: **Tier B1 — "Thin model gateway (HF-T1), stateless"** (Rule Anchor 1), from the Theo Phase 1B Backend Plan §7 gateway-first sequence. Delivers the first live, deployable Theo handler: `POST /api/theo_message` brokers a chat turn to Claude via Azure AI Foundry and returns the assistant reply. **Stateless** — no `theo_*` persistence (Tier B3). Decision Register: DR-T2 (server-side model gateway), DR-T5 (1B makes surfaces true). Per-surface: this is *real-in-1B* backend for the Chats surface gateway seam (1A handover §2.2).

## P2 — Architecture & boundary reconciliation
- **Gateway authority (DR-T2; architecture §2.2, Rule Anchors 2, 4):** a server-side gateway is the only model-credential holder; brokers the **standard Anthropic Messages API**; is the model swap point. The B1 handler realizes this. **Auth-method note (deviation, Walter-directed — see §GR G-5):** architecture §2.2/DR-T2 specify "Entra managed identity (keyless)", but per Walter's explicit directive the handler uses the **deployed Family-B raw-`https` token-exchange mechanism** (`requestUrl` → `login.microsoftonline.com` with the app's `AAD_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`, as in the deployed `exchangeGraphToken`), with `grant_type=client_credentials` to obtain an **app-only token** for scope `https://ai.azure.com/.default`. The gateway is thus the sole credential holder (aligns with the §2.2 *intent*); authorization is by an RBAC **`Cognitive Services User`** role on the app's service principal at `vaultgpt-foundry`. The `@azure/identity`/SDK approach is **not** used (not installed → empty-500); the OBO variant was rejected by `AADSTS65001` (no delegated-permission API for `https://ai.azure.com`). A Role-C to align §2.2/DR-T2's "managed identity (keyless)" to this deployed client-secret method is PRE-LAND (§GR G-5).
- **Verified connection (Plan §11, 2026-06-26):** `POST https://vaultgpt-foundry.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic/v1/messages`, model `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`, bearer scope `https://ai.azure.com/.default` → HTTP 200. The handler targets this proven endpoint.
- **Boundary (Rule Anchor 12; Conformance §10 T40):** B1 touches **no** `reporting_*` table and **no** `theo_*` table; it is a pure model broker. No Corporate Reporting access (tool-dispatch is Tier B5). No browser→model call (the gateway holds the credential server-side).
- **Identity:** authenticates the caller via Easy Auth `x-ms-client-principal` → Entra OID (mirrors the Family-B pattern); rejects unauthenticated requests (401). The OID is not yet used (stateless); it gates auth and is the seam for B3 persistence/RLS.

## P2.5 / GR — Gap Register
| Gap | Disclosure | Pivot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G-1 | **Deploy prerequisites** (Walter, at deploy), client-credentials method — **no SDK, no managed identity**: (a) Function app settings `THEO_FOUNDRY_BASE` + `THEO_FOUNDRY_DEPLOYMENT`, and the existing `AAD_TENANT_ID`/`AAD_CLIENT_ID`/`AAD_CLIENT_SECRET` (already used by the working reporting handlers) present; (b) the app's service principal (`AAD_CLIENT_ID` = "Vault GPT API") is granted **`Cognitive Services User`** on `vaultgpt-foundry` (IAM role assignment — authorizes the app-only token). | **PRE-LAND** — enumerated in §DEPLOY; Claude Code's golden curl (§CURL) confirms post-deploy. |
| G-2 | **No persistence in B1** — the turn is not saved; a refresh loses the thread. | **PROCEED** — by design (stateless gateway). Persistence + RLS land in Tier B3 (`theo_conversations`/`theo_messages`); the handler's response shape is forward-compatible. |
| G-3 | **ZDR / data residency (D-3)** — Foundry-Claude inference is Anthropic-hosted (US). | **PRE-LAND** — non-PII test traffic only until Walter confirms ZDR; gates client-PII go-live, not the B1 connection test. |
| G-4 | **Route naming** — API Spec §2.1 writes `/api/theo/message`; the deployed Family-B convention is underscore routes (no slashes). | **PROCEED** — use `theo_message` (route `/api/theo_message`) per the deployed convention + Spec §1 `theo_<operation>_<entity>`; the frontend service module (Tier B1.5) targets `/api/theo_message`. |
| G-5 | **Auth-method divergence from architecture §2.2 / DR-T2.** Those specify "Entra managed identity (keyless)"; per Walter's directive (§WA) the handler uses the **deployed raw-`https` client-secret token exchange** with `grant_type=client_credentials` (app-only token, RBAC-authorized at the Foundry resource). Implementation diverges from the doc. | **PRE-LAND** — Walter has decided (§WA); a Pass-4 **Role-C to architecture §2.2 / DR-T2** (and Theo Phase 1B Plan §4/§11 gateway-auth wording) will record the client-credentials method as the gateway auth, replacing "managed identity (keyless)". Authored after B1 is confirmed working. Surfaced here with the Walter decision so it is not silent drift (Conformance §10 T13). |

## P3 — Schema grounding
**N/A — no `theo_*` schema object in B1 scope.** The thin gateway is stateless; it creates/reads no table, column, policy, or function. The `theo_` conventions (Rule Anchor 14) and the structural table set (`theo_conversations`/`theo_messages`, PROPOSED) are introduced in Tier B3, not here. No DEPLOYED/PROPOSED schema classification is required for B1.

## P4 — Contract grounding
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/theo_message` (route `theo_message`; convention `theo_<operation>_<entity>`). Backs API Spec §2.1 Chat / model gateway (`1B-deployed` = HF-T1).
- **Request (Anthropic Messages shape, Rule Anchor 3):** `{ model?, max_tokens?, system?, messages: [{role, content}] }`. `messages[]` required and non-empty; `max_tokens` defaults to 4096 if absent; `system` optional; unknown top-level fields ignored (not forwarded). The handler injects the configured deployment as `model` (frontend need not know it).
- **Response (Rule Anchor 5):** `{ data: { role, model, content, stop_reason, usage }, meta }` where `content` is the Anthropic `content[]` **filtered to `type` text** blocks (artifact markers within text preserved for client-side parse). Family-B success envelope.
- **No Corporate Reporting endpoint consumed** (no Tool Manifest entry in B1).

## P5 — Handler grounding
**Canonical Primary Reference (Rule Anchor 6):** `reporting_probe_dms_connection` (handler + function.json), inlined verbatim in §HG. Selected because it is the deployed Family-B handler whose shape is closest to a model gateway: auth (`getPrincipal`→OID) → acquire a token → **call an external HTTPS service with a bearer token** (`requestUrl`) → map errors → return the Family-B envelope. Exactly one handler + one function.json (no composite).

## SM — Structural Mirror Table
| Region | Primary Reference (`reporting_probe_dms_connection`) | B1 `theo_message` | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `corsHeaders` | present | **byte-identical except** the `Allow-Methods` value (`POST, OPTIONS` vs `GET, OPTIONS`) | EXACT-but-method-value (endpoint delta, Golden §4) |
| `send` / `nowIso` / `errorBody` / `successBody` | present | **byte-identical** (verified) | EXACT |
| `getPrincipal` / `getClaimValue` + OID resolution + 401 | present | **byte-identical** (verified) | EXACT |
| `parseBody` / `parseJsonSafe` / `buildKnownError` / `requestUrl` (raw https helper) | present | **byte-identical** (verified) | EXACT |
| OPTIONS → 204 | present | identical | EXACT |
| `getBearerTokenFromAuthorization` / `getOboInputToken` (OBO input) | present | **omitted** (client-credentials app token; no user-token input needed) | ALLOWED DELTA — OBO-input helpers not used (Golden §4) |
| Postgres `Pool` + `set_config` session + transaction | present | **omitted** (stateless; no DB in B1) | ALLOWED DELTA — removed RLS-scoped query (Golden §4; persistence is B3) |
| `exchangeGraphToken` (raw-`https` token exchange) | present | `getFoundryToken` — **same deployed raw-`https` `requestUrl`→`login.microsoftonline.com` mechanism + `AAD_*` creds**, `grant_type=client_credentials` (app token) + scope `https://ai.azure.com/.default` | ALLOWED DELTA — same deployed token-exchange mechanism, app-only grant + retargeted scope, **Walter-directed** (Golden §4 / Conformance T12; §WA) |
| `graphGetJson` + Graph drive/site calls | present | **replaced** by the Foundry `POST /anthropic/v1/messages` call | ALLOWED DELTA — new-external-system call (the gateway's purpose), **Walter-authorized** (Golden §4 / Conformance T12; §WA) |
| input validation (`messages[]`) + final envelope | present (probe shape) | Anthropic-request validation + `content[]`-filtered envelope | ALLOWED DELTA — validated field set + response shape (Golden §4) |

**Byte-identity verification (this turn):** the 10 shared helpers in §HG.3 (`send`, `nowIso`, `errorBody`, `successBody`, `getPrincipal`, `getClaimValue`, `parseBody`, `buildKnownError`, `parseJsonSafe`, `requestUrl`) were extracted and compared against `reporting_probe_dms_connection.index.js.md` → **10/10 byte-identical**. `corsHeaders` differs only in the `Allow-Methods` value. `function.json` (§HG.4) was compared against the deployed `reporting_probe_dms_connection.function.json.md` → same bindings/keys, identical `out` binding, differing only in `methods` + `route`. The dropped regions (`pg` `Pool`/`pool`/`set_config`/transaction, `TARGET_SITE_ID`, `isUuid`, OBO/Graph helpers) are the ALLOWED-DELTA removals above (no DB / no Graph in the stateless gateway).

## WA — Walter authorization (Conformance §10 T12 / Golden §4) — quoted verbatim, predating this VEP
Walter, 2026-06-26 (this work thread), authorizing the Foundry model-gateway build and its external-system call:
> "we will use azure blob and azure postgres for our data persistence which is the most important element of the backend. you will need to walk me through the api connection/set up in azure to connect to claude api via microsoft azure foundry."

and, after the initial SDK approach failed to deploy, directing the token-acquisition method explicitly — copy the deployed handlers' proven pattern:
> "copy the way we get the token from the existing handlers that actually WORK. … are you sure you mirrored the shape and patterns of the existing handlers in corporate-reporting?"

This authorizes the deployed raw-`https` token-exchange mechanism (`getFoundryToken`, built on the same `requestUrl`→`login.microsoftonline.com` + `AAD_*` pattern as the deployed `exchangeGraphToken`) + the Foundry HTTPS Messages call, classified ALLOWED DELTA in §SM. It supersedes the `@azure/identity`/managed-identity approach (not installed → empty-500) and the OBO variant (`AADSTS65001` — no delegated-permission API for `https://ai.azure.com`); the deployment-verified method is **client-credentials (app-only token)**, authorized by an RBAC role on the app's service principal at the Foundry resource. This **refines architecture §2.2/DR-T2's "managed identity (keyless)" to the deployed client-secret method** — disclosed in §GR G-5 with a PRE-LAND Role-C. Grounded in the proven connection (Plan §11).

### HG.4 — B1 function.json to deploy (COMPLETE) — `theo_message/function.json`
```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": ["post", "options"],
      "route": "theo_message"
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ]
}
```

## P6 — SQL grounding
**N/A — no SQL in B1.** The thin gateway is stateless: no migration, seed, or handler-execution SQL. (Schema + persistence SQL begin in Tier B3.) No `theo_*` DDL is authored or executed here.

## P7 / CURL — Golden curl (Claude Code runs post-deploy)
Run by Claude Code from the live `az` session after Walter deploys (token via `az login` flow; non-PII prompt per G-3). `FUNC_BASE` is the deployed Functions app base; the Easy-Auth user scope is the deployed app registration's `access_as_user`.
```sh
az login
TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --scope "api://4e1a1e31-5c20-4480-99e4-098901707d9e/access_as_user" --query accessToken -o tsv)
curl -sS -w "\n---HTTP %{http_code}---\n" -X POST "https://vaultgpt-func-premium-a7agb7f5a8d8eeet.uksouth-01.azurewebsites.net/api/theo_message" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -d '{ "max_tokens": 64, "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Reply with exactly the two characters: ok" } ] }'
```
**Asserted response:** HTTP 200; body `data.content[0].type == "text"`, `data.content[0].text == "ok"`, `data.role == "assistant"`, `data.stop_reason` present, envelope `meta.version == "1.0"`. (401 ⇒ Easy-Auth token/scope; 500 "not configured" ⇒ missing app settings; 502 ⇒ Foundry MI/role/endpoint — check G-1.)

## DEPLOY — Walter deploy steps (no SQL; no dependency; copy-paste handler)
1. Create the Azure Function `theo_message` (HTTP trigger); paste §HG.3 `index.js` and §HG.4 `function.json` verbatim into the Azure portal UI. **No npm dependency** — the handler uses only built-in `https` (the `@azure/identity` SDK is gone).
2. **App settings** (Function App → Configuration): `THEO_FOUNDRY_BASE=https://vaultgpt-foundry.services.ai.azure.com`, `THEO_FOUNDRY_DEPLOYMENT=claude-sonnet-4-6`. Confirm the existing settings used by the working reporting handlers are present: `AAD_TENANT_ID`, `AAD_CLIENT_ID`, `AAD_CLIENT_SECRET`.
3. **RBAC on the Foundry resource:** `vaultgpt-foundry` → Access control (IAM) → Add role assignment → **`Cognitive Services User`** → assign to the **service principal of `AAD_CLIENT_ID`** (the "Vault GPT API" app). This authorizes the app-only (client-credentials) token. No managed-identity, no per-user consent.
4. Confirm deploy; notify Claude Code to run §CURL.

## P8 — VEP assembly + mechanical lint
GCR + Rule Anchor Table open the pack; P1–P8 walked (P3/P6 explicit N/A — stateless, no schema/SQL); Gap Register present; Structural Mirror + verbatim Primary Reference + complete handler/function.json + golden curl included; T40 boundary clean (no `reporting_*`/`theo_*` access). Mechanical lint (Conformance §10 T24):
