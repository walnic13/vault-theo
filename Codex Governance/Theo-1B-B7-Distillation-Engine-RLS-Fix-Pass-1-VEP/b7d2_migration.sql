-- Theo 1B — Tier B7 distillation: watermark column + cross-owner due-scan helper
-- Target: shared `vaultgpt` Azure Postgres instance, schema `public`.
-- Plain PostgreSQL SQL; no top-level BEGIN/COMMIT (migration governance). Idempotent.
--
-- The distillation timer is a server-side batch with NO signed-in user, so it cannot satisfy the
-- per-user RLS predicate (created_by = auth.uid()) on a cross-owner scan — under RLS the scan returns
-- zero rows. This adds (1) the last_distilled_at watermark and (2) a SECURITY DEFINER scan helper
-- (runs as the function owner → bypasses RLS, exactly like the deployed theo_*_exists_unscoped helpers)
-- that returns the due (id, created_by) list across all owners. The timer then sets each owner's
-- context (set_config) before reading that owner's messages/memory and writing — so isolation holds.
